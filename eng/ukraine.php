                        <h2>Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022</h2> <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is the largest armed conflict in Europe since World War II. It is the third stage of the Russian-Ukrainian war, which Russia started in 2014 by annexing Crimea and supporting separatists in Donbas. In this article, I will try to analyze the causes, course, and consequences of this conflict from the perspective of a military expert.</p> <h2>Causes</h2> <p>Russia has longstanding territorial claims to Ukraine, especially to Crimea and Donbas. Since Vladimir Putin came to power in 2000, Russia has stepped up its aggressive policy against Ukraine, including through economic pressure, propaganda, support for pro-Russian forces, and the development of its military might.</p> <p>In 2014, taking advantage of the change of power in Ukraine after the Revolution of Dignity, Russia seized and annexed Crimea and provoked an armed conflict in Donbas, where it created the unrecognized "DPR" and "LPR" with the participation of Russian mercenaries and regular troops. Attempts to peacefully resolve the conflict through the Minsk Agreements did not lead to a complete ceasefire and the implementation of the provisions on a political and humanitarian solution to the situation.</p> <p>In 2021, Russia again concentrated a significant number of its troops near the border with Ukraine, which indicated its plans for a full-scale offensive. One of Russia's main motives was to block Ukraine's path to NATO and the EU, as well as to ensure its own security and geopolitical influence in the post-Soviet space.</p>
                        <h2>The course of the war</h2>
                        <p>Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2022 at 3:40 a.m. Kyiv time, when its troops crossed the border into Belarus and Transnistria. Russian forces attacked Ukrainian positions in the north and south of the country, trying to break through to Kyiv and Odesa. The Ukrainian army resisted the aggressor, receiving support from NATO and other partner countries.</p> <p>In the first days of the invasion, Russia suffered significant losses in men and equipment, but continued to advance, using its superiority in numbers and weapons. Ukraine declared full mobilization of its forces and declared a state of war throughout the country. Large-scale fighting broke out along the entire front, which stretched along the border with Belarus and Transnistria.</p>
                        <h2>Consequences</h2>
                        <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been going on for over a year and has resulted in heavy human and material losses on both sides. According to the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense, as of April 23, 2023, Russia has killed more than 186,000 of its military and about 100,000 wounded. Ukraine, on the other hand, has lost about 13,000 dead and more than 7,000 civilian casualties. In addition, Russia has seized part of Ukrainian territory, including Kharkiv, Luhansk, Donetsk, Zaporizhzhia, Mykolaiv, Kherson, and Odesa regions.</p> <p>Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also had a serious impact on the international situation. NATO and the EU condemned Russia's aggression and provided political, economic and military support to Ukraine. Some NATO member states, such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Poland, Canada, and Turkey, even provided Ukraine with troops to participate in defense operations. On the other hand, Russia has received support from its allies such as Belarus, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. In addition, Russia has begun to escalate conflicts in other areas, such as the Baltic States, Georgia, Moldova, and Azerbaijan.</p>
